Http Service:
-----------------------------------------

Http Service will help us fetch external data, post to it, etc. 

Difference between HttpClient and Http:

	The HttpClient is used to perform HTTP requests and it imported form @angular/common/http.
	The HttpClient is more modern and easy to use the alternative of HTTP.
	HttpClient is an improved replacement for Http. 
	They expect to deprecate Http in Angular 5 and remove it in a later version.
	HttpClient is a new API that came with 4.3.
	It has updated API's with support for progress events, json deserialization by default.
	Http is the older API and will eventually be deprecated.


Step-1: import HttpModule  in app.module.ts file

import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';

imports: [
      HttpModule,
   ],

Step-2: http service in the app.component.ts file and Write the code in AppComponent class in app.component.ts file

import { Http } from '@angular/http';
import { map} from 'rxjs/operators';



export class AppComponent {

   	result:any:
   	constructor(private http: Http) {
   	}

  
   ngOnInit() {
  	this.http.get("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users").pipe(map((response) => response.json()))
	.subscribe((x) => 	this.show(x));     
   }
   show(x) {
	this.result = x;
    }
}

Step-3: The data is displayed in the browser, which is done in the app.component.html file.

<ul *ngFor = "let x of result">
   <li>Name : {{x.id}}</li>
</ul>

Step-4: Compile the following command

ng serve

Step-5: Run the application using the following url

http://localhost:4200
